# Structured Approach

## Setup
This approach uses detailed prompts, validation checkpoints, and quality standards.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Claude Code reads `prompts/system-prompt.md` first
2. Follow the phases in `prompts/task-breakdown.md`
3. Review and approve after each phase
4. Document any corrections or iterations needed

## Goal
Test whether explicit structure and guardrails produce higher quality results.
